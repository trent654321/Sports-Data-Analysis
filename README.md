## Project description/outline
We will collect the data to get total team statistics for hitting, pitching and fielding, and then see if there are statistics that correlate with team wins. Between 20015 and 2019.

## Research questions to answer
What statistic has the biggest impact on wins, and how high is the correlation?
Is it the same in the National League as the American League?
Does spending influence the win percentage?
